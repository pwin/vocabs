The asset classes include credit, equity, foreign exchange (excluding cross-currency), interest rate (including cross-currency), other commodity, and such other asset classes as may be determined by the Commission." ,
		"The three main asset classes are equities, or stocks; fixed income, or bonds; and cash equivalents, or money market instruments. Some investment professionals add real estate and commodities, and possibly other types of investments, to the asset class mix."
