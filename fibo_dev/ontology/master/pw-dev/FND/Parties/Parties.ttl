	dct:abstract "This ontology defines the high-level concepts of parties in roles, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. The concept of a party in a role describes some entity defined specifically in terms of some role which it performs in some formal contractual or transactional relationship. The ontology includes one or more basic party in role concepts. The ontology also includes one or more logical combinations of types of autonomous entity which may perform some of the party roles defined elsewhere in this ontology, such as the role of ownership." ;

		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Roles/Parties.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to combine Parties, Party Roles, and Roles in a single, new, Parties module, combine Parties and Party Roles into a single ontology, and add an inverse for the hasParty property.""" ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add a relationship directly between parties and a party identifier and rename (migrate) the hasDefinition property to isDefinedIn to clarify intent." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Parties/Parties.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add semantics to the definition of independent party, making it a direct subclass of autonomous agent (rather than inferred only) and making person and organization direct subclasses (rather than inferred only)."
