	dct:abstract """This is a conceptual ontology for the core notion of a message and the basic facts that apply to all messages. These include applications, messages and requests, as being relevant both for corporate events and for many loan related information exchanges such as loan applications. 
		Note that the newly introduced (Dec 2017) Communications module and ontology are intended to cover the same ground in a more data- and application-facing format. Some de-duplication is required for these concepts. At present parts of Provisional FIBO refer to these concepts, principally in the Corporate Actions and Events domain and in Loans.""" ;
