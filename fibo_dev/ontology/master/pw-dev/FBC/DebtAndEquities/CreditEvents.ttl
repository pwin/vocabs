Added as synonym Modeling note: Note that some of these are simple \"Yes/no\" conditions i.e. the event has happened or it has not. Others comprise more detailed information. However, 4 of those that are given as \"yes/no\" in FpML do in fact have the additional fact of Default Requirement. So almost none are simple yes/no or list entry terms. Modeled accordingly. Note also that the term Credit Event is defined more widely than just in CDS, for example in credit indices or just as business events generally.
