		This ontology covers these core concepts, so that mortgage loans, where the collateral is more specific, can be built on to of this. These concepts may not be needed for stand-along application-specific ontologies for mortgage lending as the concepts here provide the abstractions for definition of mortgage loan concepts and differentiates them from other categories of loan. These intermediate abstracations may or may not be presented in the separate Loan Contracts module for mortgage loans.""" ;
