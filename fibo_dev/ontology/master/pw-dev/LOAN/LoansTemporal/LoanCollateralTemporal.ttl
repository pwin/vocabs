If car, information, identify (registration, VIN etc.); insurance and so on. Insurance is a dated fact. If a car is collateral., you would collect updated information on an ongoing basis. this happens though registering an interest in the vehicle. Insurance companies undertake not to cancel insutrance without notifying lender if there is a lein. so they regfister an interest in a motor vehicle. so some of this event driven, some is dated, some is static. Also: Flood plain risk, flood insurance on the asset."@en ;
