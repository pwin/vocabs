There are states within the space of being in arrears where it is not yet in default unless the borrower has not paid within a given period of time. For instance a decision is made after e.g. 3 months, when it is decided they are in default - a "Notice of Default" is then served, leading into the set of legal events we see in the Loan Default Proceedings.'@en ;
