	dct:abstract "This ontology defines concepts relating to types of controlling parties. The concepts defined here are party in role concepts, which define the nature of some entity such as an organization or a legal person, in some role such as that of owning a controlling interest in the entity or of controlling that entity. These roles are defined in terms of the types of control enjoyed by the party, for example de facto or de jure control. An important feature of this ontology is the distinction between the holding of a controlling interest (such as voting shares), and the de facto existence of control of one body by another as asserted in company filings or as a conclusion drawn from computational analysis of controlling interests." ;

For instance an option to exercise which would give another 5 percent control. So there is percentage control with or without share ownership. Example: In a partnership this might be in the Partnership Agreement, which would identify beneficial ownership and control as potentially 2 distinct things. Contract can say anything. Implications: This means that there are percentages of de jure control based in contract, similar to those based in constitutional instruments (shares, General Partner equity). The concepts of Parent, Siinificant Part Owner etc. can then potentially be defined int erms of the percentages of all applicable instruments by which control may be formally defined." ;
