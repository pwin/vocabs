Such contracts usually move under the influence of interest rates. As rates rise, contracts fall in value; as rates fall, contracts gain in value. Trading in these contracts is governed in the U.S. by the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Traders use these futures to speculate on the direction of interest rates. Financial institutions use them to hedge financial portfolios against adverse fluctuations in interest rates."@en ;

	skos:definition "Agreement to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, a currency or a financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date. A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. Definition origin: Barrons, adapted by EDMC SMER."@en ;
