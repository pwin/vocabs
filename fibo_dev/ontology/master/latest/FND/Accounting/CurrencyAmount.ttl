	dct:abstract """This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas 'money amount' is defined as an amount of money, 'monetary amount' is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217.  ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support.  The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.""" ;

Where the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) will be used to describe the currency authority. This code will be allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:1997.
