	dct:abstract "This ontology provides a very high level definition of country related concepts, essentially a placeholder for use in mapping countries and intra-country concepts to the appropriate regional standards or to some as yet undefined global address ontology, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. A minimal set of geopolitical and geophysical terms are included as required for financial risk management and other application use cases, and these are all to be considered as placeholders for suitable standard ontologies for these concepts as these become available. These terms may also be mapped to controlled vocabulary standards such as ISO 3166." ;
