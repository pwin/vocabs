This is the deeper conceptual basis for concepts like capital (money with a purpose; a tool) or financial instruments in the most literal sense of that word (some contract used to achieve some investment objective). 
		This ontology is intended to be entirely conceptual, providing the disambiguation between concepts that are often conflated in natural language, and as such would almost certainly never be included in an application ontology.""" ;
