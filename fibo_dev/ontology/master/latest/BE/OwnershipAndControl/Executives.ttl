Certain statutory clauses (such as those dealing with allotment, transfer, and forfeiture of shares) must be included; the other clauses are chosen by the stockholders to make up the bylaws of the organization. A court, however, may declare a clause ultra vires if it is deemed unfair, unlawful, or unreasonable. A copy of the articles is lodged with the appropriate authority such as the registrar of companies. Articles are public documents and may be inspected by anyone (usually on payment of a fee) either at the premises of the organization or at the registrar's office. Lenders to the organization take special interest in its provisions that impose a ceiling on the borrowings beyond which the organization's management must get shareholders' approval before taking on more debt. The usual American term is articles of incorporation." ;
