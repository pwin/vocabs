The contract may make reference to a specific debt instrument or loan, or take effect in the event of one of a range of events that happen to the business entity that is the debtor in that debt. Includes terms for different kinds of settlement arrangement. Note that these are a swap in name only, since under normal conditions there is only one stream of payment, the fee payment leg." ;
