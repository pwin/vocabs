A third feature, "Knock In Knock Out" is really two of these and is represented as such in the Option terms i.e. there may be two of this Option Feature Terms term. The term "Barrier Option" applies to both of these, i.e. Knock In and Knock Out are types of Barrier Option. An option contract may or may not have a barrier option. If it does not, none of this applies. Others: knock in a knock out, knock in a digitale, if it exceeds one barrier you get a call; for another you get a put, and so on.'@en ;

Answers: You can pay the premium up front or in arrears (pre v pos tpaid) or you can pay it at any agreed time (indeed the time is already defined as terms see Payment Date), so this simply reflects that. Then there are other types of \"Participating OptionS\" where the anmount you pay depends on something else - so you don't pay the Premium up front. If it ends up outt of the money then you don't have to pay as much. So this is \"Variable\" premium. The alternative to this is \"Fixed\".

If it does take place, this will be a transaction for the purchase or sale of the deliverable underlying as defined in the option contract, or some cash equivalent thereof. Further notes: This is not any different from any other kind of derivatives transaction. The Transaction is still defined as the purchase and sale of the underlying even if it is cash settled. It is defined as the swap of the fixed price for the current market price. Would define a reference price for the current market price if it's not a physical settlement. Would for example define the use of a calculation agent. Scenarios: 1. Agree to cash settle even though the underlying is a deliverable 2. Agree to settle cash because it's difficult to get hold of the underlying 3. The underlying is by its nature not deliverable 4. Fx where the deliverable is a currency to cash delivery is synonymous with delivery of the underlying asset, so the underlying observable and the underlying deliverable are the same actual thing. How this is modeled: Cash \"Settlement\" (means cash delivery) is where you take cash instad of delivery of the underlying deliverable. Whatever is going to be delivered there is going to be a reverse transaction at the going market rate. That also covers the use of an index or basket as the underlying. Examples of this: IR Swap - not an Option."@en ;
