In option markets I don't have that opportunity - one owiuld end up overpricing the option. The variability in the price of AUS/USD v AUS/GBP impacts on these calculations. By using three legs I cna put together a cros inthe options. Buy Aus/USD Option, .buy USD/GBP Option and sell the correlation Swap. This sells the correlationbeteen AUS/USD and AUS/GBP leaving me with a realistic price for AUS/GBP thereby enabling me to cross markets. So the swap enables me not to end up overpricing the option.

REVIEW: 19 May: If you have a forward contract with a dividend before you settle there must be some terms to determine how the dividend is resolved. Similar question would apply with Bond Interst? No becaues this is a known amount so it is taken into account in the price that's been agreed (discount premium).

More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the \"index\" (we don't call it that here) is a basket of securities."@en ;
