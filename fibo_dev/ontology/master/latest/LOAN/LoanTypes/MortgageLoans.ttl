So we have for example the Registered Address determines your residency? In the US most companies are incorporeated in Delaware because they have more lenient requirements. Place of Incorporation is usually their "Place of REsidence" but they may register in various states for various reasons, and in other foreign countries (except where this is a separate leagel entity presumably?
