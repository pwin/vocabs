	dct:abstract """This ontology describes loan and mortgage loan products. A product as defined here is something marketed and offered for sale, in this case a loan, such that when a customer takes on the product, they become signatories to a corresponding loan contract. A loan product in this sense is a contractual , off-the-shelf product with terms corresponding to those in the actual contract when it is signed.
		Note that considerable work has been done on products to support a separate loan product concept in the HMDA-derived Loan Contracts module, so this work now needs integrating with that or deprecating""" ;
