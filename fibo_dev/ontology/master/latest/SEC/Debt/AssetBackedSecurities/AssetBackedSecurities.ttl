Further details from riskglossary.com: To create an ABS, a corporation creates a special purpose vehicle to which it sells the assets. While is is common to speak of the corporation as the issuer of the ABS, legally, it is the trust or special purpose vehicle that is the issuer. It sells securities to investors. To protect investors from possible bankruptcy of the corporation, there are three legal safeguards: - Transfer of assets from the corporation is a non-recourse, true sale. - Investors receive a perfected interest in the assets' cash flows. - A non-consolidation legal opinion is obtained certifying that assets of the trust or special purpose vehicle cannot be consolidated with the corporation's assets in the event of bankruptcy. These same safeguards allow the corporation to remove the assets from its balance sheet. The corporation generally continues to service the assets - collecting interest and principal payments, pursuing delinquencies, etc. It is paid out of asset cash flows for providing these ongoing services."@en ;

Action: Determine where mobile home and second mortgage based securities fit in, and add to the relevant definition. Outcome: these would be specialised kinds of pools of loans and are therefore reflected by specific typs of Cash ABS, in the same way as Auto Loan ABS are defined. Note also that an issue of ABS certificates (contracts) may have different tranches which relate to these different kinds of loan, and other as yet undefined types of loan. These are capable of extension into indefinite numbers of loan types / pool types, so it would not be practical to include all the possibilities in the standard terms other than as selectable types of loan in the loan type selection data range."@en ;

This is a method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets are nonamortizing. Controlled-amortization ABS resemble corporate bonds with a sinking fund. After a predetermined 'revolving' period during which only interest payments are made, these securities attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments that usually occur over less than a year. A risk inherent in this kind of ABS is an early amortization event. (See 'Early-Amortization Risk', on page 20.)" ;

	fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote '''The inflation rate is used to define the factor or multiplier for the bond, that is the factor that you multiply the bond by. How this works is that you take the inflation rate when the security was issued, and the inflation rate at the present. The difference between these becomes the Factor, e.g. 100% -&gt; 101% gives 1% so for example for a $1000 issue - calculate the principal on which the interest is paid AND the principal from the point of view of how the principal is repaid. Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior. Unlike an Amortizing Security this principal value of the bond is increasing, whereas for and Amortizing, the principal is decreasing. In Canada, these are also referred to as "real return bonds". 
Further Notes:Additional review with OTPP May 05 2010 indicates that this is part of a classification of bonds where the principal amount itself varies according to some index, a point which was not understood at the original review session. Terms and labels revised to fit this picture.''' ;
