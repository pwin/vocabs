		"Analytics review session notes: Dated facts (for non agency mortgage pools): Aggregate of : Scheduled payments (% and $) Payments Prepayments (% and $ notional) Default amounts (statistics: Prepayments: (start at 0 and ramp up and then level off (why?)) SMM basic measure monthly Basis CPR C? Prepayment Rate based on SMM annualised PSA based on CPR takes the COR and applies a curve to the rate of prepayments on the model. (%) e.g. 100% PSA is applied to model. 200% PSA implies x%CPR per month Tries to reflect how prepayments in a pool will accelerate and then burn out. This reflects the nature of a mortgage pool, elgl why people will prepay, refinance, address selection and so on i.e. local economy facts. so those will drop out of the pool and you are left with those who will not. that's why it levels off. So who originates these figures? Is it measured ongoing?: No . Used to determine a pricing speed when marketing the security to investors. So this is part of the primary market / issuance where there is marketing. These are the estimated figures as they will be at issue. PSA may also be used as triggers. 100 - 400% PSA band - if you go outside that band, may change payment behaviour of those classes. Defaults: measures or rate of default CDR conditional default rate (annual) MDR Monhtly default rate - like CPR = Rate over time. - both defined as Rates. (%) Figures are originated by the servicer of the debt pool. Each serviceer will have their own formats but will do info on prepayments, llosses, detauls on specific loans and so on."@en ,
		"""The class Mortgage Pool originally had a property 'pool type' referring to a selection list of textual stylings of pool types. Those are now replaced with actual sub types of mortgage pool. Here are the original notes and definition that went with the enumerated list of pool types: 

The type of pool for a pool backed security. Each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc.

Further Notes:
Non Agency signifies a tranched security, for which there will also be a Tranche Type for the security tranche itself. All other pool types are Agency pool types. 

List Populated from Cutter document Page 5. 

Additional terms from Adept Advistory:
Under Agency mortgages, basically you have various types of pools under the various agencies. You have:
-GNMA-I
-GNMA-II
-GNMA Platinum
-FNMA 
-FHLMC
-FHLMC Gold
As far as definitions:The simple definition is that each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc. Also, GNMA is explicitly backed by the US government, while FNMA and FHLMC are only implicitly backed by the US government. Perhaps there needs to be some research done on the parameters for what makes a loan conforming or not.
