dct:spatial rdfs:label "spatial"@en ;
            vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to the administrative region(s) that it covers. The value of the properly should be the URI of the region as defined in an authoritative list of regions. In Europe, this is likely to be the Administrative Territorial Units  Named Authority List maintained by the Publications Office's Metadata Registry. The ATU list does not include a geometry. That is, the territory is only identified by its name not its spatial coordinates. This is likely to be the case for similar lists. If geometries are available for the Public Organization's territory, they can be linked from the territorial unit using the Location Core Vocabulary's locn:geometry property."@en .


schema:contactPoint vann:usageNote "The contact point property links to a Contact Point that provides contact information, in particular a phone number and e-mail address. Other contact methods may be included, including online contact information, but this is conceptually distinct from the organization's homepage that may or may not provide contact information."@en ;
                    rdfs:label "contact point"@en .


schema:email rdfs:label "has email"@en ;
             vann:usageNote "A property through which an e-mail address for the Public Organisation, or a representative of it, can be contacted."@en .


schema:hoursAvailable vann:usageNote "The availabilityRestriction property links a Contact Point to details of specific details of its opening hours that override the general case."@en ;
                      rdfs:label "availability restriction"@en .


schema:logo rdfs:label "logo"@en ;
            vann:usageNote "A property to link an organization to its logo. The value of this property can simply be the URL of the logo but it is better for developers if it links to an object that provides the URL of the image and essential metadata about it, notably its dimensions. In the RDF release of the CPOV, this property is bound to schema:logo which takes either a URL or a schema:ImageObject as its value."@en .


schema:openingHours vann:usageNote "The value of this property is structured text that gives the hours at which the contact point is normally available. Days are specified using two-letter combinations: Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su. For example, if the contact point is open Monday-Friday, 9 -5, the value of the openingHours property would be Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00. If the Contact Point is only available on Tuesday and Thursday between 6 and 8pm, the value would be Tu,Th 16:00-20:00."@en ;
                    rdfs:label "opening hours"@en .


schema:telephone vann:usageNote "A property through which a phone number for the Public Organization, or a representative of it, can be contacted."@en ;
                 rdfs:label "has telephone"@en .


skos:altLabel rdfs:label "alternative label"@en ;
              vann:usageNote "In line with ORG and SKOS itself, an organization may have any number of alternative or informal names, irrespective of language."@en .


skos:prefLabel vann:usageNote "As defined in the ORG Ontology, a preferred label is used to provide the primary, legally recognised name of the organization. An organization may only have one such name in any given language. Primary names may be provided in multiple languages with multiple instances of the preferred label property."@en ;
               rdfs:label "preferred label"@en .


org:classification vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to a SKOS Concept that provides a classification. As an example, the Publications Office of the European Union provides a Named Authority list of Organization Types  which is appropriate for European institutions. Other classification schemes should be used at other levels of public organization."@en ;
                   rdfs:label "classification"@en .


org:identifier vann:usageNote "Many organizations are referred to by an acronym or some other identifier. For example, among the EU institutions, the ECB is the identifier for the European Central Bank, OLAF for the European Anti-Fraud Office, and so on. These are formally recognised by the European Commission which provides a list of such acronyms . Analogous lists should be used in other contexts."@en ;
               rdfs:label "identifier"@en .


foaf:homepage vann:usageNote "A property to link an organization to its website homepage. The value of this property is a URL irrespective of the serialisation of the data."@en ;
