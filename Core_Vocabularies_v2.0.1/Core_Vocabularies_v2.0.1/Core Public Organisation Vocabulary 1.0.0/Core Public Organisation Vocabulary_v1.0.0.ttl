dct:spatial rdfs:label "spatial"@en ;
	vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to the administrative region(s) that it covers. The value of the properly should be the URI of the region as defined in an authoritative list of regions. In Europe, this is likely to be the Administrative Territorial Units  Named Authority List maintained by the Publications Office's Metadata Registry. The ATU list does not include a geometry. That is, the territory is only identified by its name not its spatial coordinates. This is likely to be the case for similar lists. If geometries are available for the Public Organization's territory, they can be linked from the territorial unit using the Location Core Vocabulary's locn:geometry property."@en .

schema:logo rdfs:label "logo"@en ;
	vann:usageNote "A property to link an organization to its logo. The value of this property can simply be the URL of the logo but it is better for developers if it links to an object that provides the URL of the image and essential metadata about it, notably its dimensions. In the RDF release of the CPOV, this property is bound to schema:logo which takes either a URL or a schema:ImageObject as its value."@en .
# 

schema:openingHours vann:usageNote "The value of this property is structured text that gives the hours at which the contact point is normally available. Days are specified using two-letter combinations: Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su. For example, if the contact point is open Monday-Friday, 9 -5, the value of the openingHours property would be Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00. If the Contact Point is only available on Tuesday and Thursday between 6 and 8pm, the value would be Tu,Th 16:00-20:00."@en ;

<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel> vann:usageNote "As defined in the ORG Ontology, a preferred label is used to provide the primary, legally recognised name of the organization. An organization may only have one such name in any given language. Primary names may be provided in multiple languages with multiple instances of the preferred label property."@en ;

org:changedBy rdfs:label "changed by"@en ;
	vann:usageNote "The originalOrganization property links a Change Event to the organization that existed before the change. Although the Foundation Event class is defined as a sub class of Change Event, it is inappropriate to use the originalOrganization property with the Foundation Event class."@en .
# 

org:classification vann:usageNote "This property links an organization to a SKOS Concept that provides a classification. As an example, the Publications Office of the European Union provides a Named Authority list of Organization Types  which is appropriate for European institutions. Other classification schemes should be used at other levels of public organization."@en ;

# 

org:hasMember vann:usageNote "One organization may be a member of another without being a sub organization, i.e. they are independent entities. These properties allow such relationships to be captured. The memberOf and hasMember properties are very simple and don't support statements describing the nature of the membership. The W3C Organization Ontology provides both this simple method and a more sophisticated model  that does make it possible to, for example, provide information about the period of time in which one organization was a member of another, the level of membership etc. That more sophisticated model should be used where necessary and may be used in addition to the simple memberOf/hasMember properties."@en ;
	rdfs:label "has member"@en .
# 

org:hasSubOrganization vann:usageNote "Public Organizations are often large and complex and may be a collection of smaller organizations, each of which has a specific identity that may be legally defined. The hasSubOrganization and subOrganizationOf properties express the relationships between organizations in a hierarchical structure. In contrast, hasUnit and unitOf are used to link to operational departments within an organization that may not generally exist in their own right. In the RDF release of the CPOV, hasSubOrganization is bound to org:hasSubOrganization and subOrganizationOf is bound to org:subOrganizationOf."@en ;

# 

org:hasUnit rdfs:label "has unit"@en ;
	vann:usageNote "Organizations typically comprise many departments, units, teams etc. Each of these is modelled in the CPOV as a unit that is linked from the parent organization with hasUnit and to the parent with unitOf. An Organizational Unit is a sub class of Organization but conceptually does not exist in its own right. This is in contrast to a sub organization that, although part of the larger organization, may be legally distinct or otherwise enjoy a degree of autonomy."@en .
# 

org:identifier vann:usageNote "Many organizations are referred to by an acronym or some other identifier. For example, among the EU institutions, the ECB is the identifier for the European Central Bank, OLAF for the European Anti-Fraud Office, and so on. These are formally recognised by the European Commission which provides a list of such acronyms . Analogous lists should be used in other contexts."@en ;
